## Project Description 
The Simon game is a memory game where the user needs to follow a specific sequence of colors to earn a score. The longer you are able to follow additional sequences it provides the higher your score will be.

How to play: 

Simon will show a sequence of colors and tones (through boxes).
Repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.
If you make a mistake or press the wrong button, the game ends (the score goes back to 0).
Keep advancing through longer sequences to achieve a high score.

## Installation instructions & Technologies Used 
A game made using HTML CSS and Javascript. 
Went through a series of psuedocoding phases to make the game alive 


## Major Hurdles & Unsolved Problems 
Major Hurdles: 
A major hurdle for me was the css of my game. I started off using 'vh' as a unite for all my fonts and margins to try to adjust to all screen sizes till I found out how to keep things in px and adjust media quory in the exact way I wanted to!

Unsolved Problems: 
A unsolved problem for me is the leaderboards however there was just not enough time so this was not necessarily a problem just somthing I have not gotten to. 


## User Stories
-As a player, I want to be able to start the sequence when I am ready to play, so I can read the rules of the game first 

-As a player, I want to know what my score is after each additional sequence so I can keep track of how well I am doing. 

-As a player I want the boxes I select to register and show me the color confirmation that I selected the box so I can know if I have pressed. 

-As a player I want to know if I messed up the sequence to understand why my score went back down to 0 


### MVP Goals
Goals: 
-The game is fully functional with 0 errors

-The sequence continues to add new color patterns until the user messes up 

-The score continues to go up after every additional color sequence is clicked

-The boxes all flash green after each correct sequence 

-The boxes all flash red when the wrong sequence is clicked


### Stretch Goals
-A leaderboard box in the top right would be amazing this would require a lot of research 

-The screen size is adjusted for any browser size or screen making it playable by anyone
